              This patent document describes a thermal storage battery system designed to store energy as heat. 
              The system is particularly configured for applications such as drying agricultural and food products. 
              It provides a way to convert electrical energy from various sources, including solar, wind, and the grid, 
              into thermal energy for storage.

              The thermal storage battery system detailed in the patent includes essential components such as 
              a battery core shell (often made of stainless steel), a thermal storage material mixture primarily 
              composed of sand and graphite, heating elements to generate heat, and a heat extraction pipe to 
              retrieve the stored thermal energy. Various thermal insulation layers are used to enclose the core 
              and retain heat efficiently.

            <p className="mb-6">
              This technology is described as offering several advantages over conventional energy storage methods, 
              including sustained, long-term energy storage and reduced environmental impact. The system can store 
              heat at high temperatures, potentially up to 800Â°C, making it suitable for diverse industrial, 
              commercial, agricultural, and household uses beyond just drying, such as general process heat, 
              space heating, and water heating. Its use of abundant, low-cost materials like sand is also highlighted.
